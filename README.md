# QTL/targets workflow 
QTL mapping with the qtl and targets packages in R. The goal of this workflow is to organize, and to some degree automate the process of fitting QTL models with r/qtl. Specifically, the ojective is to use targets to organize both the implementation of, and comparison among several QTL models. See the writeup with [this link](https://jhgille2.github.io/QTL_targets_workflow/AnalysisWriteup.html) for more details.
